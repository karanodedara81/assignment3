## 🧮 Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial_fun` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Example Output

## 🧠 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate:
   - Square root of the number  
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### Example Output

Enter a number: 10
Result for number 10
Square root of 10 is 3.1622776601683795
Natural logarithm (log base e) of 10 is 2.302585092994046
Sine of 10 is -0.5440211108893698
